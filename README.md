Grandma's recipe from "Indra's Pearls"

by Alassane Diagne and Aysegül Peközsoy for the seminar "Illustrating Mathematics" at Heidelberg University SS 2022

This program performs Grandma's recipe from "Indra's Pearls" by David Mumford, Caroline Series and David Wright. The algorithm can be found on p.227.

Grandma's recipe is an algorithm in the book that gives us for two complex numbers ta and tb two möbius transformations a and b with tr(a) = ta, tr(b) = b and the limit set generated by these two transformations looks pretty, is symmetrical under 180° rotation and has a discrete fractal shape for many input parameters.

Our program is written in JavaScript using p5.js and allows you to plot the limit set generated by the transformations you get by selecting the input parameters ta and tb. You can select them by either moving the sliders in the complex plane or entering them manually in the lower bar.
